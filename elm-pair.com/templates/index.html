<p>Elm-pair helps you write Elm code. You tell Elm-pair about the change you want to make and it will do the actual work. It's a bit like using an IDE, except you don't need to learn any keyboard shortcuts.</p>

<p>You talk to Elm-pair by making a change in your code. If Elm-pair understands your intent will follow up by making a change off its own.</p>

<hr />

<p>Rename a variable and Elm-pair will propagate the new name wherever the variable is used. The same is happens when renaming types and constructors.</p>

<hr />

<p>As you change an import statement alias or exposing list, Elm-pair will make change your code to keep it compiling.</p>

<hr />

<p>Elm-pair integrates with your editor of choice. Currently Neovim is supported and Visual Studio Code support is on the way, with support for additional editors planned.</p>
